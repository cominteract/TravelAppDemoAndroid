# TravelAppDemoAndroid
app for checking out venues around you using foursquare api

This app is based/ patterned after android-sunflower

A gardening app illustrating Android development best practices with Android Jetpack.
https://github.com/android/sunflower

Libraries used should be the same plus some added like 

Retrofit - turns your HTTP API into a Java interface
Dagger 2 - is dependency injection framework. It is based on the Java Specification Request (JSR) 330. It uses code generation and is based on annotations. 

The idea is to put together most of the most modern changes/best practices within Android while mantaining a simplistic approach to android development (should be easy to reproduce or be based as a template for more serious projects).
